		What We Do
	</h1>
	<h2 class="mb-3">
		<span class="tab"></span>
		Metering and Reports
	</h2>

	<p class="lead"> 
		<span class="tab"></span>
		In the oil and gas industry, metering and reporting play the important role of accurately measuring and monitoring parameters essential for effective production, transportation, and processing of hydrocarbons. Flow meters, in particular, are instrumental in quantifying the volume of oil, gas, or other fluids moving through pipelines, providing crucial data for production optimization and allocation. The accurate measurement of flow rates is paramount for ensuring efficient resource utilization, meeting regulatory requirements, and facilitating precise billing in the complex network of oil and gas operations. That's where we come in. We measure gas flow with modern flow computers and Barton chart recorders. Our service package offers a spectrum of services. Not only do we offer meter calibration and seamless communication, but we also offer monthly downloads and reports.

		<span class="tab"></span>
		Equipment Leasing, Service, Hookup and Maintenance
	</h2>
	<p class="lead">
	    <span class="tab"></span>
	    Because of our natural fit with equipment, we have always planned to add equipment leasing and maintenance to our services. That plan is now a reality. Using our relationships with skilled mechanics and operators, we offer most services for shop and field machine needs. Our leasing options are flexible to meet the needs of our clients for both short- and long-term projects. For any services we cannot outright provide, our extensive network allows us to get in contact with the right people to still get the job done.<br/>
	    <span class="tab"></span>
	    In addition to our leasing and maintenance services, we have crews available for piping, plumbing and onsite plant and tank hookups for oil and gas operations. Our tema is equipped with reliable technology and expertise to handle these needs safely and efficiently.

	<h2 class="mb-3">
		<span class="tab"></span>
		Crypto Mining
	</h2>
	<p class="lead">
	    <span class="tab"></span>
	    In a very short amount of time, we have accumulated significant interest from industry participants in mining cryptocurrencies. Our packages involve innovative approaches to utilizing stranded gas and power cryptocurrency miners. One of our ongoing projects uses an existing strand production in Laurel, Mississippi, making it available and simple for our clients to get their mining started.
